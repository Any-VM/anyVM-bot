this bot allows you to control your vm remotely (configured with debian commands)
simply fill out the env and create a user on the vm with a strong password, currently stopping and starting the vm is not fully tested and doesnt really work
then just npm install package.json then node server.js  and you should be good to go.
i will try to update this but will not test it, im moving on with anyvm-bot v2 for proxmox

how this bot works is it uses reg commands in linux shell (debian) to run mostly everything, in the future i hope to change the user to instead run on root instead of the user who's running it (currently just pipes the password for sudo) 

start and stop vm is designed for gcp api, currently doesnt really work, intended for start.sh and start.js to run on a seperate vm to check the main vm by just pinging it, when it finds that its down it will send the start command to discord to allow you to start the vm and then allow the bot on the main vm to send the normal commands (by shutting off the one on the other vm) 

the userids.json file is to store the userids of the people who create an account on discord, for now its only used for the change password command but its helpful for moderation. it stores the discord id and username of the account on the vm.
