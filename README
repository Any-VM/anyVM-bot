this bot allows you to control your vm remotely
simply fill out the env, currently stopping and starting the vm is not fully tested and doesnt really work
then just npm install package.json then node server.js  and you should be good to go.
i will try to update this but will not test it, im moving on with anyvm-bot v2 for proxmox
